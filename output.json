Please write at least 3 sentences.\" They answered: \"I am a struggling person, I have tried my best in life and made a lot of accomplishments to be proud of, but in recent years I have lost a lot and haven't really managed to recover despite my best efforts. I am a vulnerable person, I have little to no support system in any aspects of my life and one mistake or misfortune can set me back or even ruin me at this juncture. I am a cynical person right now, the pragmatism that I aspire to when applied to the current realities I face leads me to feel that a genuine sense of hopelessness, pessimism, or cynicism is entirely well reasoned. It makes it hard for a person like me to hold onto hope when my reasons for feeling despair are fully intellectualized and despair seems like a fair reaction.\"",
